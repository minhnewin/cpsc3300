# cpsc3300

Cpsc3300 is a Databases course I took in Winter 2022.  

I worked on a Pizza Restaurant Management Database. This database keeps track of the customer orders, customer order history, employee work hours, and pizza restaurant menu for a local pizza restaurant. The restaurant will be a local restaurant with delivery services. This database can be used by the employees at the restaurant including the manager and the owner to determine business needs and restaurant profits. This project helped me understand relatinal models and relationships between entities. I used PHP and HTML.
